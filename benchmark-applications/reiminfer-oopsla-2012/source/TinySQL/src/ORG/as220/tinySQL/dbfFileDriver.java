/**
 * dBase read/write access <br>
 * This driver understands the following properties:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>encoding<br>
 * The default encoding used for table data. Enter a valid encoding string,
 * such as "Cp1252" or "Cp850". If the choosen encoding is not supported by your
 * system, an exception is thrown whenever a table is read. This property defaults
 * to "Cp1252" which is "Windows ANSI"-Encoding. See DBFHeader for a list of
 * supported encodings.
 * <li>autoenc<br>
 * If this boolean property is set to true, tinySQL tries to determine the encoding
 * of an existing table automaticly. If the encoding cannot be detected, the default
 * encoding is used. This value defaults to true.
 * <li>readonly<br>
 * If this property is set, the database is readonly and cannot be modified.
 * This feature is usefull when opening files on read-only media. The value defaults
 * to false.
 * </ul>
