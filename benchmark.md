## Basic Assignment Test Cases
We create a basic set of assignment test cases that are: (a) systematic: the test cases are generated by starting from the assignments allowed by the language model, and (b) exhaustive: every possible assignment within the Java language is tested. Since an object can be mutated only through field assignments, and aliasing is not considered, any immutability analysis tool should be expected to pass these test cases.

To ensure systematic, exhaustive coverage of basic assignment cases, it is important to note that all mutations occur as a result of an update (assignment after initialization) to a field. Let us first consider updates to class variables, instance variables, and array components of fields. Array fields must be given special attention because there is no language mechanism to enforce the immutability of array components and updates to array components mutate the object containing the array field. Fields can be categorized into three groups, class variables, instance variables of another object instance, and instance variables of “this” object instance. Finally, we consider assignments involving stack variables, i.e. parameters passed and returned values. The high level assignment patterns can be represented succinctly as an assignment graph as shown in the figure below. Each node in the assignment graph corresponds to a set of program artifacts that can be on the left hand side or right hand side of an assignment. Each edge in the assignment graph can be instantiated multiple times, one for each pair of program artifacts in the source and destination node to generate a valid Java assignment. For instance, the downward edge to the right side of the assignment graph generates assignments from a final object, an Enum, a `this` reference, a primitive (`byte`, `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`), `null` or a String literal to a parameter. We enumerate all possible assignment pairs from the assignment graph to produce a total of 250 test cases.
