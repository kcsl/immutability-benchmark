The results of each tool's performance on the Immutability Benchmark can be found at: [github.com/kcsl/immutability-benchmark/tree/master/harnesses](https://github.com/kcsl/immutability-benchmark/tree/master/harnesses).

## Test Harnesses
The benchmark comes bundled with several virtualized test harnesses to easily reproduce benchmark results for various immutability analysis implementations. See below for instructions to run each test harness.

- [ReImInfer-0.1.2](https://github.com/kcsl/immutability-benchmark/tree/master/harnesses/ReImInfer-0.1.2)
- [ReImInfer-0.1.3](https://github.com/kcsl/immutability-benchmark/tree/master/harnesses/ReImInfer-0.1.3)
- [Immutability Toolbox](https://github.com/kcsl/immutability-benchmark/tree/master/harnesses/ImmutabilityToolbox)
